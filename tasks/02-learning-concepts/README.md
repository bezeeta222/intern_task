## Important Tips

### 1. Don't Just Read
- Pause and think about each concept
- Try explaining it to someone else
- Sketch diagrams yourself

### 2. Look at Examples
- Each concept has code examples
- Try to understand what each line does
- You'll write similar code later

### 3. You Don't Need to Memorize
- It's OK if you don't understand everything
- You'll learn by doing
- Understanding grows with practice

### 4. Use The Analogies
- Concepts are compared to real-world things
- LEGO blocks, restaurants, filing cabinets
- These help concepts stick

## Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to memorize all this?**
A: No! Understanding is enough. Memorization comes with practice.

**Q: Is this going to be on a test?**
A: No tests! This is project-based learning. You learn by building.

**Q: What if I don't understand something?**
A: Totally normal! Read it again, Google the concept, watch a video.

**Q: Can I skip parts?**
A: You could, but I recommend reading all of it. Each part builds on the last.

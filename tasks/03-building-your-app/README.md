## What You'll Build

A **Movie Explorer App** that:

- üé¨ Searches the TMDB movie database
- üì∏ Displays movie results with posters and ratings
- ‚ù§Ô∏è Lets users save favorite movies
- üì± Works on desktop and mobile devices
- üöÄ Can be deployed to the internet

## Project Timeline

- **Day 1-2**: Build the basic structure and search feature
- **Day 3**: Display movie results beautifully
- **Day 4**: Add favorite/bookmark functionality
- **Day 5**: Polish and optimize your app

**Total Time**: 1-2 weeks (5-10 hours per week)

## Getting Started with PRD

Now that you have `PRD.md`, you should:

1. **Read the overview** - Understand what you're building
2. **Follow day by day** - Don't jump ahead (Day 1-5)
3. **Complete each task** - Before moving to the next day
4. **Test everything** - Make sure features work
5. **Commit to GitHub** - After each day
6. **Use troubleshooting guide** - When you get stuck ([reference guide](../../reference/troubleshoot.md))

---

## Skills You'll Practice

### JavaScript & React
- Writing React components
- Using hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Managing component state
- Handling events

### APIs
- Making API requests
- Handling responses
- Error handling
- Environment variables

### Styling
- Tailwind CSS classes
- Responsive design
- Component styling
- Mobile-first approach

### Git & GitHub

## Project Setup

Before starting the PRD tasks:

1. ‚úÖ Complete [01 - Getting Started](../01-getting-started/)
2. ‚úÖ Complete [02 - Learning Concepts](../02-learning-concepts/)
3. ‚úÖ Have your terminal and VS Code ready
4. ‚úÖ Know where your project folder is

---

## Daily Workflow

Each day will follow this pattern:

```
1. Read the day's objectives
2. Look at code examples
3. Write your code
4. Test in browser
5. Commit to GitHub
6. Move to next day
```

---

## Success Tips

### 1. Code Along
- Don't copy-paste (type it out!)
- This helps your hands learn the syntax

### 2. Test Frequently
- Run `bun dev` after each change
- Check browser for errors (F12)
- Test all features

### 3. Understand First
- Read example code before copying
- Understand each line
- Ask "why" for every step

### 4. Ask for Help
- Share your code on GitHub
- Use error messages to debug
- Ask in communities with code examples

### 5. Take Breaks
- Programming is mental work
- Your brain needs rest
- Progress feels faster after a break

## Common Challenges

**Challenge: "I don't understand the task"**
- Re-read the objective
- Look at code examples
- Try it and see what happens

**Challenge: "My code has an error"**
- Check browser console (F12)
- Read the error message carefully
- Search the error on Stack Overflow
- Check [Troubleshooting Guide](../reference/troubleshoot.md)

**Challenge: "I'm behind schedule"**
- That's OK! Learning takes time
- Quality over speed
- Focus on understanding, not rushing

**Challenge: "I can't think of how to code this"**
- Look at examples
- Break it into smaller steps
- Draw a diagram
- Pseudocode it first

**Q: Can I update my app after deploying?**
A: Yes! Push changes to GitHub → Vercel auto-deploys.

**Q: Can I use my own domain name?**
A: Yes! See custom domain section in [deployment.md](./deployment.md).

**Q: Is this the final step?**
A: For this project, yes! But you could keep improving your app.

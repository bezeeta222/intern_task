## What is Deployment?

### Local vs Deployed

**Local Development:**
- Runs on your computer
- Only you can access it
- URL: `http://localhost:3000`
- Stops when you close terminal

**Deployed:**
- Runs on internet server
- Anyone can access it
- URL: `https://your-app.vercel.app`
- Always running

### Why Deploy?

- üåç Share with others
- üéØ Show on portfolio
- üì± Works on any device
- ‚ö° Always available

   ```
   https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/movie-explorer-learning
   ```
4. Click "Import"

#### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

1. You'll see "Environment Variables" section
2. Add your TMDB API key:
   ```
   Name: NEXT_PUBLIC_TMDB_API_KEY
   Value: your_api_key_here
   ```

## Deploy to Netlify

### Alternative to Vercel

If you want to try Netlify instead:

#### Step 1: Prepare Project

Netlify works better with a build step:

```bash
# Build the project
bun run build

# This creates a .next folder
```

#### Step 2: Connect GitHub

1. Go to https://netlify.com
2. Click "Sign Up"
3. Choose "Continue with GitHub"
4. Authorize Netlify

#### Step 3: Create New Site

1. Click "New site from Git"
2. Choose your repo
3. Set Build Command: `bun run build`
4. Set Publish Directory: `.next`

#### Step 4: Add Environment Variables

1. Go to Site Settings ‚Üí Build & Deploy ‚Üí Environment
2. Add your TMDB keys:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_TMDB_API_KEY=your_key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_TMDB_BASE_URL=https://api.themoviedb.org/3
   ```

#### Step 5: Deploy

1. Click "Deploy"
2. Wait for build
3. Get your live URL

## Custom Domain

### Add Your Own Domain

Once deployed, you can add your own domain name:

```
Vercel URL:    https://movie-explorer-abc123.vercel.app
Custom Domain: https://my-movie-app.com
```

### How to Get a Domain

1. Go to domain registrar:
   - Namecheap (cheap)
   - GoDaddy (popular)
   - Google Domains (simple)

2. Search for domain you want

3. Buy it (usually $10-15/year)

### Connect Domain to Vercel

1. In Vercel dashboard, go to Settings
2. Domains section
3. Add your domain
4. Follow DNS instructions
5. Takes 24 hours to activate

## Environment Variables on Deployment

### Important: Never Commit Secrets!

Your `.env.local` file should NEVER go to GitHub:

**Already ignored?** Check `.gitignore`:

```
.env.local  ‚Üê Should be here
```

If not, add it now!

### Set Variables on Platform

Each platform (Vercel, Netlify) has a way to set environment variables:

**Vercel:**
1. Dashboard ‚Üí Project
2. Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
3. Add your keys

**Netlify:**
1. Site Settings
2. Build & Deploy ‚Üí Environment
3. Add your keys

---

## Troubleshooting Deployments

### Issue: "Build Failed"

**What to do:**
1. Check build logs in dashboard
2. Look for error message
3. Fix in your code
4. Push to GitHub
5. Auto-redeploy

### Issue: "API returns 401"

**Likely cause:** Environment variables not set

**How to fix:**
1. Go to deployment platform settings
2. Check NEXT_PUBLIC_TMDB_API_KEY is set
3. Verify value is correct
4. Re-deploy

### Issue: "Blank page or 404"

**Likely cause:** Wrong build directory

**How to fix:**
1. Check build settings
2. For Next.js: should be `.next`
3. Check publish directory matches
4. Re-deploy

### Issue: "App works locally but not deployed"

**Common causes:**
- Missing environment variables
- Wrong build settings
- `.gitignore` excluded important files
- Case-sensitive path issues

**How to debug:**
1. Check build logs
2. Verify env variables
3. Check `.gitignore`
4. Test locally again

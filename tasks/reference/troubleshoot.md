## General Debugging Tips

### Rule #1: Read Error Messages Carefully

**Most Errors Tell You Exactly What's Wrong!**

When you see an error:
1. **Read it completely** (don't just see "Error" and panic)
2. **Look for line numbers** - tells you WHERE the problem is
3. **Look for the actual message** - tells you WHAT is wrong
4. **Try to understand it** - it's usually clear in English

Example error:
```
Error: Cannot find module 'axios'
```

This tells you: "You're trying to use a module called 'axios' that isn't installed"

Solution: `bun install axios`

### Rule #2: Check Browser Console

The browser console shows errors that happen in your code:

**How to open:**
- Windows/Linux: Press F12
- Mac: Press Cmd + Option + I

**Look for:**
- Red text = Errors (fix these!)
- Yellow text = Warnings (usually OK)
- Blue text = Logs (your debug info)

### Rule #3: Check Server Console

The terminal where you ran `bun dev` also shows errors:

```bash
$ bun dev

> next dev --port 3000
  ‚ñ≤ Next.js 15.1.3

‚úì Ready in 1.5s

‚ö†  Error: Cannot find module...  ‚Üê Error appears here
```

### Rule #4: Google the Error

Copy the error message and google it:

```
"Cannot find module 'shadcn/ui'" next.js
```

Stack Overflow usually has the answer!

### Rule #5: Try These First

Before digging deeper, try:

1. **Save your file** - Sometimes editors don't save automatically
2. **Restart dev server** - Ctrl+C then `bun dev`
3. **Clear node_modules** - `rm -rf node_modules && bun install`
4. **Clear cache** - `rm -rf .next && bun dev`
5. **Restart terminal** - Close and open new terminal

## API & Fetching Issues

### Issue: 401 Unauthorized from TMDB API

**What it means:** API key is wrong or missing

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_TMDB_API_KEY=your_key_here
   NEXT_PUBLIC_TMDB_BASE_URL=https://api.themoviedb.org/3
   ```

2. Verify API key is correct:

- No internet connection
- URL is malformed

**How to fix:**
1. Check your internet connection

---

### Issue: API returns empty results

**What it means:** Search term found no movies

**This is normal!** Not every search has results.

**How to fix:**
Try a popular movie:

### Issue: "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'results' of undefined"

**What it means:** API response doesn't have expected data

**How to fix:**
1. Check API response in browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/api/search?q=batman
   ```

2. Verify response has `{ results: [...] }`

3. Check your API route returns correct format:
   ```javascript
   return Response.json(data)  // Should work
   return Response.json({ results: data.results })  // More explicit
   ```

## Display & Styling Issues

### Issue: Layout looks broken on mobile

**What it means:** Responsive design not working

**How to fix:**
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Click mobile icon (top left)

```

---

### Issue: Text overlapping or unreadable

**What it means:** Font size or spacing issues

   ```javascript
   useEffect(() => {
     const stored = localStorage.getItem('movieFavorites')
     // ... rest of code
   }, [])
   ```

3. Check localStorage isn't full:
   - F12 ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Local Storage

## Performance Issues

### Issue: App is slow

**What it means:** Something is making it sluggish

**How to fix:**

1. Check network speed (F12 ‚Üí Network)
   - Images taking long to load? Normal!
   - API taking long? Check internet

2. Check DevTools Performance tab
   - See what's taking time

3. Common causes:
   - Too many movie cards rendering
   - Images not optimized
   - Component re-rendering too much

4. Solution:
   - Use React.memo() for cards
   - Lazy load images
   - Reduce animations

---

### Issue: API calls taking forever

**What it means:** TMDB API is slow

**This is usually normal!** TMDB is a free service.

**How to check:**
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Do a search
4. Look at API request time
5. If >3 seconds, it's the API, not your code

**What you can do:**
- Add timeout logic
- Show loading state (you already do!)
- Cache results

---

### Issue: Page is unresponsive after search

**What it means:** Too much processing happening

**How to fix:**
1. Add loading state (you have this!)
2. Show skeleton loaders while fetching
3. Limit results displayed
4. Use pagination

---

## Still Stuck?

### When nothing works:

1. **Read the error message again** - 90% of the time it tells you the answer
2. **Google the exact error** - Stack Overflow probably has answer
3. **Check the code** - Usually syntax error nearby
4. **Try the nuclear option**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules
   bun install
   bun dev
   ```

5. **Ask for help** with:
   - Exact error message
   - What you did before error
   - Code relevant to error
   - What you've already tried

## Remember

**Every error is a learning opportunity!** When something breaks:

1. Don't panic - it's fixable
2. Read the error - it helps
3. Search for solution - others had it too
4. Learn from it - now you know for next time
5. Keep going - you've got this!

## Error Message? Don't Panic!

### The Golden Rule

**Most error messages tell you exactly what's wrong.**

When you see an error:

1. üìñ **Read it completely** - Don't just see "Error" and give up
2. üîç **Look for line numbers** - Shows WHERE the problem is
3. üí¨ **Read the message** - Shows WHAT is wrong
4. üß† **Try to understand it** - It's usually written in English

### Example

```
Error: Cannot find module 'axios'
```

This tells you: "You're trying to use something called 'axios' that isn't installed"

**Solution**: `bun install axios`

## General Debugging Tips

From the troubleshooting guide, remember:

### Rule #1: Read Error Messages
- Copy the full error message
- Search it on Google
- Stack Overflow usually has an answer

### Rule #2: Check Browser Console
- Press F12 to open DevTools
- Red text = Errors (fix these!)
- Yellow text = Warnings (usually OK)

### Rule #3: Check Server Console
- The terminal where you ran `bun dev` also shows errors
- Pay attention to what it says

### Rule #4: Try These First
1. Save your file
2. Restart dev server (Ctrl+C then `bun dev`)
3. Clear cache (`rm -rf .next && bun dev`)
4. Restart terminal completely
